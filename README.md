Overview: For our project, we focused on designing GreenMate, an Android application that incentivizes users to live a more sustainable lifestyle. Acting as a tool to promote walking, riding bikes, and recycling, the app employs a customized character that changes on user input through a point system. The main functions of GreenMate include a step counter that records the user's walking or bike-riding and a recycling database and counter that communicates whether an inputted item can or cannot be recycled and increments the user's 'points' based on what they enter.
